`src` package for the Habit Tracker application.

This package exposes the domain models (`models`), persistence
(`database`), analytics helpers (`analytics`), and the CLI entrypoint
(`main`). The package is intentionally small and explicit to make
importing individual components straightforward in tests and scripts.
